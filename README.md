# Prefix-table-unit-change
This code appears to be a C++ program that allows the user to convert between different units with prefixes, such as pico, nano, micro, milli, killo, mega, giga, and tera. These prefixes are often used in the metric system to denote multiples or fractions of a base unit. The code provides the ability to convert quantities from one prefixed unit to another.

Here's a summary of how the code works:

It defines some global variables, including strings for the input unit, the output unit, and two integers for the amount and choice. It also defines vectors to store the prefixes and their corresponding values.

The show function displays a menu for the user, where they can select to convert from the simple unit to other units, from other units to the simple unit, or exit the program.

The convert and convert2 functions are used for converting between units. They take an index (corresponding to the selected prefix) and an amount and return the converted value.

The process function is the core of the program. It repeatedly displays the menu, takes user input for their choice, and processes their selection.

Depending on the user's choice, the program handles conversions between the simple unit and other units or exits the program.

The main function starts the program by calling the process function.

Overall, this code seems to be a simple utility for unit conversions with prefixes. It could be useful for calculations involving various metric prefixes, such as in science or engineering. If you have any specific questions or need further explanations about this code, please let me know.
